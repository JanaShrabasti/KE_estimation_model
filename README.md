# KE_estimation_model
This repository contains the code used for estimating the kinetic energy (KE) required for reaching movement trajectories in monkeys, specifically for trajectories that were not naturally performed. The model was developed as part of a study investigating the energy efficiency of different trajectory shapes in reaching movements.
